#### What is Rapid Least Concern?
Rapid Least Concern helps users determine whether any plant species is likely to be assessed in a lower risk category of extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species, and if so, it generates the documentation required to publish on the Red List. To do this, it utilises two major sources of plant data – [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/species/search) and [Plants of the World Online](http://plantsoftheworldonline.org/) provided by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Essentially, it is a rapid method for generating Red List compliant Least Concern assessments of plants as a step towards assessing the Red List status of all plants. Currently only around 8% of plants have been assessed and published on the Red List and there are a potential 200,000 species likely to be in the Least Concern category. We have made the tool specific to plants, but the application could be modified to support other mega-diverse and under-assessed groups to support their conservation.

There are two demonstration videos that illustrate how to use the ‘Single’ assessment workflow and the ‘Batch’ assessment workflow:
