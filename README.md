Last updated: 3rd March 2019

This is a first attempt at some Help notes to support use of **"Rapid LC"** - a tool to generate IUCN Red List Least Concern assessments.


Structure of the help page 
--------------------------
Background:
What is RapidLC? 
RapidLC is a web tool that automates the documention of non-threatened 'Least Concern' plant species so that they can be sent for publication on the IUCN Red List (link). 

Why create RapidLC?
Although comprehensive for some groups such as birds and mammals, the IUCN Red List only represents about 7% of known plant species diveristy. There is an urgent need to increase the coverage of plants on the Red List. The rate of new plant species assessments being published on the Red List is very slow, with only a few thousand being published each year. 

Recent changes to Red List rules such as the reduction in documentation requirement for Least Concern taxa and increased availablility of data through repositories like GBIF and POWO all the documetaiton process to be autoamted.
