### Background: 

This is a first attempt at some Help notes to support use of **"Rapid LC"** - a tool to generate IUCN Red List Least Concern assessments.

#### What is Rapid Least Concern?


#### Why create Rapid Least Concern? 

### How to use:
There are two options for generating LC assessments: single and batch. The single option allows more control in selecting names and exploring occurrence distributions. The batch option allows users to upload a csv. file with a list of names that can be processed as a batch.
#### Single
Enter a binomial (Genus species) into the search box. Two tables of results will appear in the main panel to the right. The upper table shows the results after running a search of the binomial against the GBIF names backbone. The best matches are listed in order of confidence. The scientificName field includes the author and can be used to make sure you can find the species you are looking for.  
The lower table shows the results after running the name against the Plants of the World (POWO) names backbone.
